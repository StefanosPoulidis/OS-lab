#EXERCISE 1

In this exercise we had to deal with process management and communication between them. 
The exercise has two parts.
In the first part you are asked to build a given process tree (ยง 1.1) and extend it to any tree, based on an input file (ยง 1.2). 
In the second part, you activate the processes in a specific order, using signals (ยง 1.3) and perform a parallel calculation of a numerical expression, using piping to propagate the intermediate results (ยง 1.4).
